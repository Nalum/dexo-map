# Dexo Worlds Galactic Map

This project is using data provided by the creator of [DexoWorlds](https://dexoworlds.com) to allow exploring the Galaxy
Veran Way.

## What are DexoWorlds?

DexoWorlds are NFT collectibles of 11,008 planets orbiting around 2,500 stars that live in the fictional Veran Way Galaxy.
Created by astrophysics students, the entire galaxy and its contents are procedurally generated— this includes its map,
stars, and planets. This means that each pixelated planet has its own unique properties: color scheme, pattern, rings,
moons, life, and more! The main goal behind DexoWorlds is to fill the space that lies between science, art, and
decentralized technology, tying into our vision of “50% science, 50% art”. We hope that our CNFTs and Discord community
can make astronomy and astrophysics fun and feel accessible to everyone.

## What are the future plans?

We want to implement a bunch of cool features to further support the DexoWorlds ecosystem, including ways to facilitate
sales and trading directly on the site with smart contracts. In phase 2 of the DexoWorlds projects, NFTs of each star in
the Veran Way will be distribtued to those who hold all of the planets which orbit that star. Our ultimate goal is to
promote science, astronomy, and create accessible, generative art on the Cardano blockchain.

## Is there any real science here?

Yes! Well, some. The concept of DexoWorlds is based upon the scientific field of [Exoplanet Searches and Characterization](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/overview/).
The types of stars you can find, including their properties (like mass, surface temperature, color, etc.) are all based
on what you might [actually find in a typical spiral galaxy](https://chandra.harvard.edu/edu/formal/stellar_ev/story/index3.html).
In addition, the locations of the planets around these stars determine if conditions are right for there to be liquid
water and potentially life on each planet. In terms of the colors, rings, and moons, well, we took some artistic
liberties. In all, DexoWorlds are 50% science and 50% art!
